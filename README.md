# circleArray
Javascript function that consists in giving it an array, a starting index and the output size of the new array. 


The function will out put an array of the length size you gave it at start, but if will cycle through the array if it gets past the length 
of the original array 

Therefore if you have this [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and you tell the function to give you an array starting at index 6 of size 5 the output would
look like this [7,8,9,1,2] and so on
